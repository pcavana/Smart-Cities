Air pollution in New York City (NYC) is a critical issue that demands attention; residents are exposed to a complex mixture of pollutants including PM2.5, Black Carbon, Ozone (O3), Nitric Oxide (NO) and  Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). This study investigates the spatial distribution of these pollutants across NYC's boroughs and within the Unified Health System areas (UHF42), examining their sources and impacts on public health. Special attention is given to factors such as vehicle emissions which significantly contribute to local air quality degradation. Through data science methodologies, this study offers a thorough analysis of spatial and temporal trends in these pollutants, identifies high-risk areas, and suggests interventions to mitigate associated health risks. The correlation between these pollutants and diseases like asthma is a focal point of the findings. These insights underscore the critical importance of addressing air quality in urban planning and public health policies to enhance the well-being of city residents.
